1.difference between document and window obect?

The window object represents a window/tab containing 
a DOM document where as document object is property 
of window object that points to the DOM document loaded 
in that window. You can access a document object either 
using window.


window
It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents 
of the webpage. Whenever a window appears on the screen to display 
the contents of the document, the window object is created.
The document object is your html, aspx, php, or other document 
that will be loaded into the browser. The document actually gets 
loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, 
URL, cookie, etc. What does this really mean? That means if you want to 
access a property for the window it is window.property, if it is document 
it is window.document.property which is also available in short as document.property.

 With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. 
The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document
